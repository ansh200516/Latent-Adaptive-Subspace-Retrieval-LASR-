### Problem Type 11: Boat Problem

**Definition**: This type of problem involves the speed of a boat, the speed of the current, and the time taken to travel upstream or downstream. The boat speed refers to the speed of the boat in still water, and the current speed refers to the speed of the water flow. When the boat is moving downstream, the speeds of the boat and the current are added; when moving upstream, the current speed is subtracted from the boat speed.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- (Downstream speed + Upstream speed) ÷ 2 = Boat speed
- (Downstream speed - Upstream speed) ÷ 2 = Current speed
- Downstream speed = Boat speed × 2 - Upstream speed = Upstream speed + Current speed × 2
- Upstream speed = Boat speed × 2 - Downstream speed = Downstream speed - Current speed × 2

### Problem Type 13: Clock Problem

**Definition**: This type of problem studies the relationship between the hour hand and the minute hand on a clock, such as when the two hands overlap, are perpendicular, form a straight line, or form an angle.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- The minute hand moves 12 times faster than the hour hand.
- The speed difference between the two hands is 11/12.

**Solution Strategy**: Convert the problem into a "catch-up" or "difference multiple" problem.

**Example**: Starting from 4 o'clock, after how many minutes will the hour and minute hands overlap?

**Solution**:
According to the quantitative relationship, each minute the minute hand gains (1 - 1/12) = 11/12 of a clock division on the hour hand. At 4 o'clock, the hour hand is ahead of the minute hand by 20 divisions. Therefore, the time required for the minute hand to catch up is:

20 ÷ (1 - 1/12) ≈ 22 minutes

### Problem Type 14: Surplus and Deficit Problem

**Definition**: This type of problem involves distributing a certain number of items among a certain number of people. In one distribution, there is a surplus (surplus), and in another, there is a deficit (deficit). Alternatively, both distributions may have a surplus or both may have a deficit.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- If there is both a surplus and a deficit:  
  Total number of participants = (Surplus + Deficit) ÷ Distribution difference
- If there are two surpluses or two deficits:  
  Total number of participants = (Larger surplus - Smaller surplus) ÷ Distribution difference  
  Total number of participants = (Larger deficit - Smaller deficit) ÷ Distribution difference

**Solution Strategy**: Determine which type of surplus and deficit problem it is, then directly apply the formula.

**Example**: If each child in a kindergarten is given 3 apples, there are 11 apples left. If each child is given 4 apples, 1 apple is short. How many children are there? How many apples are there in total?

**Solution**:
This is a surplus and deficit problem. Directly apply the formula:  
First, calculate the number of children:  
(11 + 1) ÷ (4 - 3) = 12 children

Then, calculate the total number of apples:  
3 × 12 + 11 = 47 apples

### Problem Type 15: Work Problem

**Definition**: This type of problem involves the relationship between work quantity, work efficiency, and work time.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- Work quantity = Work efficiency × Work time
- Work time = Work quantity ÷ Work efficiency
- Work time = Work quantity ÷ (Efficiency of A + Efficiency of B)

**Solution Strategy**: The key to solving such problems is to treat the total work as "1" and then apply the formula.

**Example**: A project would take Team A 10 days to complete alone, and Team B 15 days to complete alone. How many days will it take if both teams work together?

**Solution**:
Treat the project as "1". Team A completes 1/10 of the project per day, and Team B completes 1/15 of the project per day. Together, they complete (1/10 + 1/15) of the project per day. Therefore, the time required to complete the project is:

1 ÷ (1/10 + 1/15) = 1 ÷ 1/6 = 6 days

### Problem Type 16: Cows Eating Grass Problem

**Definition**: This problem was proposed by the famous scientist Newton. The key characteristic of this problem is that the grass grows while being eaten.

**Quantitative Relationships**:  
Total grass = Initial amount of grass + Grass growth per day × Number of days

**Solution Strategy**: The key is to calculate the daily grass growth.

**Example**: A field can feed 10 cows for 20 days or 15 cows for 10 days. How many cows can eat the grass in 5 days?

**Solution**:
Let the daily grass consumption per cow be 1 unit. Solve the problem in five steps:

1. Calculate the daily grass growth:  
   50 ÷ (20 - 10) = 5 units

2. Calculate the initial amount of grass:  
   15 cows × 10 days - 5 units × 10 days = 100 units

3. Calculate the total grass available in 5 days:  
   Initial grass + Grass growth in 5 days = 100 + 5 × 5 = 125 units

4. Calculate how many cows can eat the grass in 5 days:  
   125 ÷ (5 days × 1 unit per cow) = 25 cows

The first type of problem involves being given the total number of chickens and rabbits and the total number of legs, and then finding how many of each there are. The second type involves being given the total number of chickens and rabbits and the difference between the number of chicken legs and rabbit legs, and then finding how many of each there are.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- For the first type:  
  Assuming all are chickens:  
  Number of rabbits = (Total legs - 2 × Total animals) ÷ (4 - 2)  
  Assuming all are rabbits:  
  Number of chickens = (4 × Total animals - Total legs) ÷ (4 - 2)
  
- For the second type:  
  Assuming all are chickens:  
  Number of rabbits = (2 × Total animals - Leg difference) ÷ (4 + 2)  
  Assuming all are rabbits:  
  Number of chickens = (4 × Total animals + Leg difference) ÷ (4 + 2)

**Solution Strategy**: Determine which type of chicken and rabbit problem it is, then apply the corresponding formula.

**Example**: There are 35 heads and 94 legs in total. How many chickens and rabbits are there?

**Solution**:
Assuming all are rabbits, use the formula:  
Number of chickens = (4 × 35 - 94) ÷ (4 - 2) = 23 chickens  
Number of rabbits = 35 - 23 = 12 rabbits

### Problem Type 18: Profit and Loss Problem

**Definition**: This type of problem involves the relationship between cost price, profit, profit margin, loss, and loss rate.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- Profit = Selling price - Cost price
- Profit margin = (Selling price - Cost price) ÷ Cost price × 100%
- Selling price = Cost price × (1 + Profit margin)
- Loss = Cost price - Selling price
- Loss rate = (Cost price - Selling price) ÷ Cost price × 100%

**Solution Strategy**: Use the formulas and their variations to solve the problem.

**Example**: The average price of a certain product increased by 10% in January, and then decreased by 10% in February. What is the price change from the original price to the price in February?

**Solution**:
Assume the original price is "1".  
The price in January is:  
1 × (1 + 10%) = 1.1

The price in February is:  
1.1 × (1 - 10%) = 0.99

Thus, the price in February has decreased by:  
1 - 0.99 = 1%

### Problem Type 19: Bank Interest Problem

**Definition**: This type of problem involves the relationship between principal, interest rate, and deposit term.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- Annual (or monthly) interest rate = Interest ÷ Principal ÷ Number of years (or months) × 100%
- Interest = Principal × Number of years (or months) × Annual (or monthly) interest rate
- Total amount = Principal + Interest = Principal × (1 + Annual (or monthly) interest rate × Number of years (or months))

**Solution Strategy**: Directly apply the formulas.

**Example**: Daqiang deposited 1200 yuan in the bank at a monthly interest rate of 0.8%. After the deposit term, he withdrew a total of 1488 yuan, including interest. How long was the deposit term?

**Solution**:
First, calculate the total interest:  
1488 - 1200 = 288 yuan

Then, calculate the total interest rate:  
288 ÷ 1200 = 0.24

Finally, calculate the deposit term:  
0.24 ÷ 0.8% = 30 months

**Solution**:
Let the number of students in Class B be \( X \), so the number of students in Class A is \( 90 - X \).  
Based on the problem, the equation is:  
\( 90 - X = 2X - 30 \)

Solve the equation:  
\( 90 + 30 = 3X \)  
\( X = 40 \)

Thus, Class B has 40 students, and Class A has \( 90 - 40 = 50 \) students.
