# Latent Adaptive Subspace Retrieval (LASR)

> A Framework for Context-Aware Reflection Retrieval

## Abstract

Effective reflection is critical for the adaptation and learning of autonomous agents. A key challenge is retrieving the most relevant reflection from a large registry that is not just semantically similar, but contextually appropriate for a given situation. Existing methods relying on static semantic search often lack this deep contextual precision. We propose the Latent Adaptive Subspace Retrieval (LASR) framework, a novel multi-stage architecture designed to address this gap. LASR first employs an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index for efficient candidate retrieval. Its core innovation is a dynamic reranking stage that, for each query, constructs a low-rank thematic subspace from the candidate pool using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). By projecting candidates onto this adaptive subspace, LASR scores them based on their thematic coherence with the overall context, rather than on simple proximity to the query.

## Introduction

The ability of an autonomous agent to learn from past experiences is fundamentally tied to its mechanism for reflection. Systems like Buffer of Thoughts have demonstrated the value of maintaining a registry of reflections. However, the efficacy of such a registry hinges entirely on the retrieval mechanism's ability to surface the most pertinent reflection for a new, unseen situation.

Current approaches often rely on vector-based semantic similarity (e.g., cosine similarity), which operates on a principle of finding the nearest neighbor to a query embedding. While fast, this method has a key limitation: it is context-agnostic. It may retrieve a reflection that is a strong semantic match on the surface but fails to align with the deeper, multi-faceted theme of the agent's current context.

This research will show that the correct entities in a document form a thematically coherent cluster that can be identified by finding a low-rank subspace in the embedding space. The principal components of this subspace represent the core "patterns" or "themes" of the context.

We propose to adapt this powerful philosophy to the problem of reflection retrieval. Instead of asking, "Which reflection is closest to my query?", we ask, "Which reflection best fits the underlying theme of all plausible reflections for this query?"

## The LASR Framework

LASR is a multi-stage framework designed to balance retrieval speed with deep contextual modeling. It is composed of a one-time offline preparation phase and a dynamic online processing loop for each query.

### Offline Preparation: Building the Searchable Index

1.  **High-Dimensional Embedding**: All reflection templates in the registry are encoded into high-dimensional, semantically rich vectors (e.g., d=768) using a state-of-the-art sentence transformer (e.g., SBERT).
2.  **Retrieval-Optimized Reduction**: To enable fast retrieval, we use UMAP to reduce the embedding dimensionality (e.g., to d=32). UMAP is chosen over PCA for this specific step due to its superior ability to preserve the local neighborhood structure of the data, which is critical for the performance of an ANN index.
3.  **ANN Indexing**: The resulting low-dimensional embeddings are indexed using an efficient ANN library like Faiss or HNSW.

### Online Processing: Dynamic Thematic Retrieval

For each incoming query:

1.  **Fast Candidate Retrieval**: The query is embedded, and the ANN index is used to retrieve a large set of K candidate reflections (e.g., K=50). This set forms the initial, plausible context pool.
2.  **Dynamic Subspace Modeling**: This is the central contribution of our framework.
    -   We retrieve the original high-dimensional embeddings for the K candidates to form a candidate matrix `ED`.
    -   We perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on `ED` to find its principal components.
    -   The top `p` principal components (the "meta patterns") and their corresponding singular values (`Vp`, `Σp`) are extracted. These components form an orthonormal basis for a low-rank subspace that captures the dominant semantic themes present across the entire candidate set. This subspace is adaptive, created uniquely for every query.
3.  **Subspace Reranking**: Each of the K candidates is then scored based on its alignment with this dynamic thematic subspace. The score is the squared L2 norm of the candidate's embedding projected onto the subspace, weighted by the thematic strength (singular values):

    ```
    Score(candidate_i) = || embedding_i * Vp * Σp ||₂²
    ```
    The K candidates are then re-ranked according to this new "thematic fit" score. A high score indicates strong alignment with the core themes of the situation.

4.  **Final Precision Reranking (Optional)**: To achieve maximum precision, the new top-P candidates (e.g., P=5) from the subspace reranking can be passed to a slower but more powerful cross-encoder model, which performs a final pairwise comparison with the query before the argmax selection.

## Key Innovations and Differentiators

-   **From "Nearest" to "Coherent"**: LASR fundamentally shifts the retrieval paradigm from finding the nearest neighbor to finding the most thematically coherent member of a plausible set.
-   **Dynamic, Context-Aware Modeling**: Unlike static retrieval systems, LASR's core model (the thematic subspace) is built on-the-fly, adapting itself to the unique semantic signature of every incoming query and its candidate pool.
-   **Robustness to Noise**: The subspace modeling step is inherently robust to noise in the initial candidate set. Outlier or weakly related candidates will have minimal influence on the orientation of the principal components, and will subsequently receive low thematic fit scores. This acts as a powerful semantic filter.

## Conclusion

The LASR framework offers a principled approach to overcoming the context-agnostic limitations of simple semantic search for reflection retrieval. By integrating the speed of ANN retrieval with the deep, dynamic modeling of low-rank subspaces, it promises to deliver more accurate, robust, and contextually appropriate reflections, thereby enhancing an agent's ability to learn from its experience. Future work will involve exploring weighting schemes within the SVD computation and analyzing the emergent "meta patterns" for interpretability.
